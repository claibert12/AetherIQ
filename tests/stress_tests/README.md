# AetherIQ Stress Testing Suite

This suite provides comprehensive stress testing capabilities for the AetherIQ platform, focusing on performance, scalability, and reliability under various load conditions.

## Features

- Configurable user load patterns
- Multiple test scenarios (workflow optimization, security compliance, resource management)
- Real-time metrics collection
- Resource usage monitoring
- Detailed test reports and visualizations
- Customizable test parameters

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- Virtual environment (recommended)

## Installation

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

The test suite is configured through several files:

- `config.py`: Base configuration, test scenarios, and user load steps
- `metrics_collector.py`: Metrics collection and reporting settings
- `runner.py`: Test execution parameters

Key configuration options:
- Base URL for API endpoints
- Test duration and intervals
- User load patterns
- Resource monitoring thresholds
- Reporting formats

## Running Tests

1. Basic test execution:
```bash
python run_tests.py
```

2. Custom output directories:
```bash
python run_tests.py --results-dir custom_results --log-dir custom_logs
```

## Test Results

The test suite generates several types of output:

1. Logs:
   - Detailed execution logs
   - Error tracking
   - Performance metrics

2. Metrics:
   - Response times
   - Error rates
   - Resource usage (CPU, memory)
   - Request throughput

3. Reports:
   - Individual test summaries
   - Overall test suite summary
   - Performance visualizations
   - Threshold violation reports

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Workflow Optimization
Tests the platform's ability to handle various workflow types:
- Sequential workflows
- Parallel workflows
- Conditional workflows

### 2. Security Compliance
Validates security features and compliance requirements:
- Access control
- Encryption
- Compliance checks

### 3. Resource Management
Tests resource allocation and management capabilities:
- CPU allocation
- Memory management
- Storage operations

## Interpreting Results

The test results provide insights into:

1. Performance Metrics:
   - Average response time
   - Maximum response time
   - Request throughput
   - Error rates

2. Resource Usage:
   - Peak CPU usage
   - Peak memory usage
   - Resource allocation patterns

3. Scalability Indicators:
   - Performance under increasing load
   - Resource usage trends
   - System stability metrics

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. Connection Errors:
   - Verify the base URL configuration
   - Check network connectivity
   - Ensure the platform is running

2. Resource Constraints:
   - Adjust user load parameters
   - Modify resource monitoring thresholds
   - Check system resources

3. Test Failures:
   - Review error logs
   - Check test configuration
   - Verify test prerequisites

## Contributing

When contributing to the test suite:

1. Follow the existing code structure
2. Add appropriate documentation
3. Include test cases for new features
4. Update the README as needed
